sort(<tTable> [, <Comp>])

Description (from LUA 4 Manual: 6.1 Basic Functions 
"Sorts table elements in a given order, in-place, from <tTable>[1] to <tTable>[n], where n is the result of getn(<tTable>) (see Section 6.1). If <Comp> is given, then it must be a function that receives two table elements, and returns true (that is, a value different from nil) when the first is less than the second (so that not comp(a[i+1], a[i]) will be true after the sort). If <Comp> is not given, then the standard Lua operator < is used instead. 
The sort algorithm is not stable (that is, elements considered equal by the given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort)."

Example

names = {"Peter", "Paul", "Mary"}
grades = {Mary = 10, Paul = 7, Peter = 8}
sort(names) --> Mary, Paul, Peter
sort(names, function (n1, n2) return grades[n1] > grades[n2] end) --> Mary, Peter, Paul

Arguments

<tTable>: the table to sort.
<Comp>: Not really sure what this is. -Mikail. Example taken from 'Programming in lua' to show how the 'comp' function works; it is useful to sort complex tables or a table in accordance to another table with common entries. -Sun Tzu
