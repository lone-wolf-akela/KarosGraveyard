addCloud(<sObjName>, <sCloudType>, <tPosition>, <tColor>, ?, <fSize>)

Description

Adds a cloud to a ".level" file.

Example

addCloud("polySurface1", "Cloud_NoRes", {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, 0.0, 0.0)

Arguments

<sObjName>: name of the cloud.
<sCloudType>: the type of cloud. Can be any of the following:

"Cloud_0"
"Cloud_NoRes"
"Cloud_NoRes2"
"Cloud_NoRes3"

<tPosition>: a table containing the cloud's X, Z, and Y coordinates.
<tColor>: a table containing the cloud's red, green, and blue color values, as well as its opacity (alpha). Color values must be a between 0 and 255. Opacity (alpha) must be a value between 0 and 1.
?: dunno.
<fSize>: the radius of the cloud.

Notes

Colors are compounded when items overlap in the same locations. This intensifies the color effect. If you put two nebula's in the same location with different colors, the resulting color is a combination of the two with double the strength. -iron_man123
Clouds, dust clouds, and nebulae are only colored on the side that is lit by the local lighsources. Seen from the other side, they will appear to be black. -bobthedog
