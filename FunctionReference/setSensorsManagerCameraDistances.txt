setSensorsManagerCameraDistances(<fMinDistance>, <fMaxDistance>)

Description

Defines minimum and maximum zooming distance of the camera in the sensor manager. 
Notes: min and max distances significantly different from the standard Relic maps can cause visual bugs (like a white background and invisible ships); the bugs might be related to the camera tunable values. Tests needed.-SunTzu

Example

setSensorsManagerCameraDistances(9000, 40000)

Arguments

<fMinDistance>: mininum distance between focal point and camera when zooming in.
<fMaxDistance>: mininum distance between focal point and camera when zooming out.
