seek(<FileHandle> [, <sWhence>] [, <iOffset>])

Description (from LUA 4 Manual: 6.4 I/O Facilities 
"Sets and gets the file position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file, to the position given by <iOffset> plus a base specified by the string <sWhence>, as follows: 


"set"
base is position 0 (beginning of the file); 
"cur"
base is current position; 
"end"
base is end of file; 


In case of success, function seek returns the final file position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file. If the call fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error. 
The default value for <sWhence> is "cur", and for <iOffset> is 0. Therefore, the call seek(file) returns the current file position, without changing it; the call seek(file, "set") sets the position to the beginning of the file (and returns 0); and the call seek(file, "end") sets the position to the end of the file, and returns its size."
