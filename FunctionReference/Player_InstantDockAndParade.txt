Player_InstantDockAndParade(<iPlayerIndex>, <sSobGroupName>, <bUseHyperspaceEffect>)

Description

Makes the player's fleet instantly dock (or parade, if they can't dock) with the first ship in <sSobGroupName>.
Note: this function temporarily overrides the default launching behavior for ships that enter the shiphold: you will have to manually order the ships (or use the SobGroup_Launch function) to force them to exit the shiphold.

Example

Player_InstantDockAndParade( 0, "PlayerMothership", 0 )

Arguments

<iPlayerIndex>: the index number of the player.
<sSobGroupName>: the name of the sobgroup.
<bUseHyperspaceEffect>: enable/disable the hyperspace effect.
