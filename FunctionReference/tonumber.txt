tonumber(<Element> [, <iBase>])

Description (from LUA 4 Manual: 6.1 Basic Functions 
"Tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number, then tonumber returns that number; otherwise, it returns nil. 
An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter `A' (either upper or lower case) represents 10, `B' represents 11, and so forth, with `Z' representing 35. In base 10 (the default), the number may have a decimal part, as well as an optional exponent part (see Section 4.2). In other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted."

Example


Arguments
