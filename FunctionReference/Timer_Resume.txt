Timer_Resume(<Index>)

Description

Resumes the countdown of a timer that has been paused.
Note: the function does not check whether the timer has been paused or not, and will mess up the countdown if it is already running. It is wise to update a flag each time the timer is paused/run, and then verify it before calling the function. -SunTzu.
Note: this function is defined in "\Homeworld2\Data\scripts\scar\scar_util.lua".

Arguments

<Index>: the index (integer or string) within the timer table.
