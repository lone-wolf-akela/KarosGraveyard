isAnimRunning(<sShipname>, <sAnimName>)

Description

Returns true if the named animation is currently running.

Example

if (isAnimRunning(ship, "Open") ~= 0) then

...

end

Arguments

<sShipname>: the name of the ship. I'm guessing that this is a string, and is the same as the name of the ship file (minus the extension).
<sAnimName>: the name of the animation. This is set in the ship's .events file.
