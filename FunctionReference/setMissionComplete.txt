setMissionComplete(<bMissionComplete>)

Description

Ends the mission with either an "complete" or "incomplete" status.
If the .campaign file associated with the gamerule uses the postLevelComplete function, then the next mission will automatically begin if <bMissionComplete> is set to 1.
Note: this function can only be used inside singleplayer campaigns. Use setGameOver to end the game in multiplayer/skirmish or stand-alone/tutorial missions. setGameOver also works in a campaign mission with a postLevelComplete function; it ends the game and starts the next mission. -SunTzu

Example

setMissionComplete(0)

Arguments

<bMissionComplete>: 0 = incomplete, 1 = complete.
