SobGroup_SetHealth(<sSobGroupName>, <fHealth>)

Description

Sets the health of all ships in <sSobGroupName> to <fHealth> times the maximum value.
Note: this function is a mirror function of SobGroup_TakeDamage.
Note: I think that setting a ships health to zero while it is in hyperspace causes the ship's debris to remain in hyperspace, as well. -Mikail

Example

SobGroup_SetHealth("Communications_Station", 0.4)

Arguments

<sSobGroupName>: the name of the sobgroup.
<fHealth>: a multiplier between 0 and 1.
