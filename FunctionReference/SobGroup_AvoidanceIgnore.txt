SobGroup_AvoidanceIgnore(<sSobGroupName1>, <sSobGroupName2>)

Description

Makes <sSobGroupName1> ignore the collision boxes of <sSobGroupName2>, so that it can fly through it (without damage). Ironically enough, that does not seem to work with the Balcora Gate, perhaps due to its 'SuperPriority' avoidance family --SunTzu

Example

SobGroup_AvoidanceIgnore("group1", "group2")

Arguments

<sSobGroupName1>, <sSobGroupName2>: the names of the sobgroups

Scope
