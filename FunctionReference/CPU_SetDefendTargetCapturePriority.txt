CPU_SetDefendTargetCapturePriority(<iPlayerIndex>, <iTargetIndex>)

Description

Presumably sets the defense assignment indexed as <iTargetIndex> as a priority for the CPU with <iPlayerIndex>. I don't know if the priority is set only against enemy capturers, as the name of the function would suggest. Tests needed. - SunTzu

Example

CPU_SetDefendTargetCapturePriority(1, DefendGehenna)

Arguments

<iPlayerIndex>: integer index of the CPU
<iTargetIndex>: index of the defense assignment set up with CPU_AddDefendTarget
