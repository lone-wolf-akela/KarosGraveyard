SobGroup_FormHyperspaceGate(<sGate1Name>, <sGate2Name>)

Description

Forms a hyperspace link between <sGate1Name> and <sGate2Name>.
Note: the gates must already be deployed.
Note: deployment does not cost any RU.
Note: the linked gates remain independent sobGroups -- i.e., the order of the arguments used with the SobGroup_UseHyperspaceGate function determines which of the two gates is considered the entryway, and which is considered the exit.

Example

SobGroup_FormHyperspaceGate("WaveOne_Gate_3a", "WaveOne_Gate_3b")

Arguments

<sGate1Name>, <sGate2Name>: the names of the sobGroups containing the hyperspace gates.
