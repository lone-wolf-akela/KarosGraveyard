setWorldBoundsOuter(<tPosition>, <tDimensions>)

Description

Defines the area in which the camera may be moved using camera panning. The area is centered around <tPosition>, and is scaled along each axis by the vector <tDimensions>. 
Notes: It seems to be automatically adjusted to match the inner bounds until a certain size. I don't know if this function has other effects. -SunTzu

Example

setWorldBoundsOuter({0, 0, 0,}, {35724.5, 35724.5, 35724.5,})

Arguments

<tPosition>: a table containing the center coordinates of the playing space.
<tDimensions>: a table, or vector, containing the dimensions of the area along each axis.
