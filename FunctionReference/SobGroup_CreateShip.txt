SobGroup_CreateShip(<sSobGroupName>, <sSquadronName>)

Description

Creates a <sSquadronName> in <sSobGroupName> and returns a runtime SobGroup containing the squadron.
The squadron will exit the shiphold or hyperspace in, depending on its normal build behavior, as set in ship tuning.
Note: this works only, if the original sobgroup contains a builder, e.g. a Mothership, Carrier or Shipyard. -Age2uN
Note: if the sobgroup doesn't contain a builder, use SobGroup_SpawnNewShipInSobGroup() instead. -Mikail

Example 

SobGroup_CreateShip("Player_Ships0", "vgr_lasercorvette") 
This would add a Vaygr Laser corvette to the first player in the game (player 0).
