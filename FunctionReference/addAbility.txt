addAbility(<rShipTable>, <sAbilityName>, ...see Abilities...)

Description
	Adds an ability to the ship, such as the ability to attack, cloak, or turn on a defense field. Found in ".ship" files.
	Most abilities can either start out active or inactive. If inactive, the ability can be activated by researching an upgrade or building a subsystem (or by another ship using the addShipAbility function).

Example
	Depends on the ability. See below...

Arguments
	<rShipTable>: this will generally be a reference NewShipType.
	<sAbilityName>: the name of the ability.
	... : Depends on the ability. See below...

				Dynamic Target Priorities
					In conjunction with AttackPriorityMultiplier, the Balance Mod updates many ships with the ability to make smarter choices when attacking ships they are less effective against.

					Example of the default targeting priority of an Hiigaran Interceptor:
					"Fighter, Fighter_hw1, Corvette, Corvette_hw1, Frigate, Utility, SmallCapitalShip, BigCapitalShip, Mothership"

					Example of an updated targeting priority of an Hiigaran Interceptor:
					"Fighter, Fighter_hw1, Corvette, Corvette_hw1, Frigate, Utility,,,,, SmallCapitalShip, BigCapitalShip, Mothership"

					The extra commas create a delineation point in the targeting priority. Homeworld 2 Classic/Remastered prioritizes targets on 0 to 10000 scale (lowest is highest priority) but it's fixed, linear and weighted by distance. Inserting blank commas into this example means that the Hiigaran Interceptor will be more likely to retarget and attack ships that it is better against (Fighter through Utility) even if they are a little further away then ships that it might be closer to (in this case Destroyers, Cruisers, Motherships). This system is designed to reduce ships from fixating on targets just because they are closer. This system is only active during bandbox, AI, and automatic retaliation attacks, explicit player targeting overrides the priority.
				----------------------------------------------------------------				
				<sAttackStyle>: the default method (style) that the ship will use to engage all targets.
				<StyleException1> thru <tStyleExceptionN>: exceptions that override <sDefaultAttack> for the specified family.
